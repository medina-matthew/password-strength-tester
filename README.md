# password-strength-tester

This project will be my first project. I will be doing a password strength tester in python.

# Project Overview

You will be asked to input a password into the terminal where my program will test its strength.

Some of the main factors include:
  Length: 
  Upper Case letters:
  Lower Case Letters:
  Numbers:
  Special Characters:
  Common Passwords:
  Password Entropy:

Once tested, the tester will provide feedback and recommendations based off of critera met/not met.

Possible ratings include:
  Super Weak
  Weak
  Okay
  Strong
  Extra Strong

# Usage Examples

Input any of these passwords to see what their strength would be, as well as some recommendations as to how to make it stronger:

# Future Improvements

Some future improvements that I would like to try and add include:
  Recommended password generator 
  Feedback to about how long it would take for the password to be compromised
